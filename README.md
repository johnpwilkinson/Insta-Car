# Welcome to InstaCar, our awesome Capstone project!

This is our final project for Kenzie Academy, a group effort. We are creating an Instagram-like photo-sharing service, geared specifically for car enthusiasts.

## Features

Will add to this section as we add features...

With photos!


## Work in progress

Any features we want to add in the future, that we didn't get a chance to add for the school project. We can expand on it later!
